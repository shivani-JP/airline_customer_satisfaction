# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis

This dataset contains an airline passenger satisfaction survey with 22 features. Our goal is to identify factors highly correlated with passenger satisfaction or dissatisfaction.

Customer feedback is essential for improving business performance. Each review provides valuable insights and highlights areas for enhancement. Through in-depth analysis of the feedback data, significant insights were gained.

The dataset comprises feedback from 10,282 flight passengers, reflecting the daily challenges faced by the airline industry. Ensuring customer satisfaction is crucial to mitigate the potential damage from negative feedback sequences. Standard procedures such as check-in, baggage handling, and onboard services were scrutinized, along with behavioral impacts affecting the feedback experience. 

This project focuses on understanding how the airline caters to both business and economy class passengers. Improvements in these services could lead to an increase in the airline's business. Customer satisfaction influences customer loyalty, a factor thoroughly explored in this analysis. We examine factors influencing positive and negative feedback, focusing on areas for improvement in airline services.
